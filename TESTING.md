Testing was performed continously during development. A large amount of credit goes to Chrome developer tools and the function to adjust device dimensions to simulate different devices.
At the last stage of development Lighthouse (also in Chrome dev tools) was used to test site performance and fix a few things for SEO and Accessibility, results from the lighthouse test is included below.



## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C HTML Validation

[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test all the HTML on the site

* index.html passed with no errors
* reviews.html passed with no errors
* contact.html passed with no errors
* thank-you.html passed with no errors

### W3C CSS Validation

[W3C CSS Validator \(Jigsaw\)] (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to test the CSS

* style.css passed with no errors

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
